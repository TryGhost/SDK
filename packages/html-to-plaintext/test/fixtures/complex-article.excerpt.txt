Getting Started


Before diving in, make sure you have the following tools installed:


 * Node.js (v18 or higher) — the JavaScript runtime
 * npm or yarn — package managers
 * A code editor like VS Code


Pro tip: Always use a version manager like nvm to handle multiple Node.js versions on your machine.



Project Structure


Here's what a typical project looks like:


project/
├── src/
│   ├── index.js
│   ├── components/
│   └── utils/
├── test/
├── package.json
└── README.md



Working with APIs


Modern apps rely heavily on APIs. Here's a simple fetch example:


const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);


The response will contain fields like id, name, and created_at.




Deployment & Hosting


There are several options for deploying your application:


 1. Traditional hosting with Apache or Nginx
 2. Platform-as-a-Service like Heroku or Render
 3. Serverless with AWS Lambda



That's all for now! Stay tuned for part 2 where we'll cover testing, CI/CD, and monitoring.
