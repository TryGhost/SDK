The Complete Guide to Modern Web Development

Welcome to our comprehensive guide on modern web development. This article covers everything you need to know about building websites in 2024.
For more details, visit our documentation [https://example.com/docs] or contact us at hello@example.com.


Getting Started

Before diving in, make sure you have the following tools installed:
 * Node.js (v18 or higher) — the JavaScript runtime
 * npm or yarn — package managers
 * A code editor like VS Code [https://code.visualstudio.com]

> Pro tip: Always use a version manager like nvm to handle multiple Node.js versions on your machine.


Project Structure

Here's what a typical project looks like:

project/
├── src/
│   ├── index.js
│   ├── components/
│   └── utils/
├── test/
├── package.json
└── README.md


Working with APIs

Modern apps rely heavily on APIs. Here's a simple fetch example:

const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);

The response will contain fields like id, name, and created_at.

Deployment & Hosting

There are several options for deploying your application:
 1. Traditional hosting with Apache or Nginx
 2. Platform-as-a-Service like Heroku [https://heroku.com] or Render [https://render.com]
 3. Serverless with AWS Lambda [https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/]

That's all for now! Stay tuned for part 2 where we'll cover testing, CI/CD, and monitoring.
